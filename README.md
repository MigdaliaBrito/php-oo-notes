## PHP OO Curriculum

Object Oriented programming is a methodology employed by many different programming environments today.  Building a solid foundation in the fundamentals will play a critical role in our ability to adapt to different environments over time. 

In our PHP OO training, we will explore all of the core principals of the methodology and how they are implemented within PHP. This day long training is designed as a hands on tour where each student will be implementing solutions first hand. 

We will start with general knowledge applicable to all OO environments and further focus on PHP specifics. We will end with an introduction to some core Drupal concepts and how they relate to the OO foundation we poured during the day.
