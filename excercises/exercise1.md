##Exercise 1: Car Manager


# Introduction

You have been hired by a local car dealership to extend an inventory management system they are running. Their previous developers created a system but forgot to develop some of the core objects needed to run the system.

This is where you come in. 

# Phase 1
## Requirements
Develop a Car class which allows us to instantiate a single Car object. The car object should encapsulate data pertaining to an individual car. This data will include the following:

1. Make (String)
2. Model (String)
3. Year (Int)
4. Price (Float)
5. Used (Boolean)
6. Milage (Float)
7. Color (Sting)

Each property of the car should have corresponding setter and getter methods for working with a Cars properties.

## Deleriables
A single file named Car.php which will define the data structure needed. Our internal team will integrate your work into the main information system.

## Timeline
You have 30 minutes to deliver this work.
