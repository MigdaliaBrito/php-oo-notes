##Exercise 2 - Extending our Car class

# Introduction
Our dealership client keeps growing. They are now moving into the exotic car market. It turns out this market is much different from the Cars they have been selling up to this point. These types of customers look for differnent attributes when making a purchase descions. These attributes include number of models produced, weight, and horsepower.

#Phase 2
##Requirements
Extend the Car class to be able to support an ExoticCar. The ExoticCar should contain all the same properties and methods of the Car but with the following additional properties and methods: 

1. Number Produced
2. Weight
3. Horsepower

They will also need a new method to be able to calculate the power to weight ratio for the ExoticCar. 

## Deleriables
A new class defined in the same project we defined the Car class in. The ExoticCar class should live in the same namespace as the Car.
