## Exercise 3 - Expanding our markets.

# Introduction
The exotic car market is proving to be a difficult market to capitalize. Our client is making a bold shift into the tractor market. With their platform growing they need to ensure their software systems enforce some stronger standards. 

# Phase 3
## Requirements
We need to define a new interface called VehicleInterface. This interface will enforce the implementation of the following methods:

1. Price (setters and getters)
2. Make (setters and getters)
3. Model (setters and getters)

We will also need a new Tractor class which implements this interface. 

Lastly, they would like us to ensure the existing Car and SuperCar classes implement this interface properly.

## Deliverables
A new interface called VehicleInterface declaring the methods outlined above. A new class Tractor implementing this new interface. Please include basic tests for the Tractor.

## Timeline
You have 30 minutes to deliver this work.
